That’s just how it works. Somewhere in its infinite scroll, there exists a perfectly structured essay written entirely in 🍔🔥🤖, explaining the meaning of life.

## Credit where it's due

The Library of Emoji was inspired by the Library of Babel.

In particular, I found the mathematics described in the [repo for libraryofbabel.app](https://github.com/tdjsnelling/babel) very helpful.
